# linuxconf
My linux configuration with i3 windows manager, light-dm login auth, polybar
Don't forget to sudo chmod +x .config/polybar/launch.sh && sudo chmod +x .config/polybar/spotfiy.sh (This makes the two shell scripts executable, otherwise they will not work, cuz the system will not have permission to launch them)
